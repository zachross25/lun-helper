# Lun-helper (chrome extension)

This is a Chrome extension designed to enhance the user experience on [https://lun.ua](https://lun.ua),
 a website that lists thousands of residential buildings under construction.

One key feature missing from the site is the ability to hide unwanted buildings from the list,
 and that's where this extension comes in!

With the extension, you can simply press the "Hide" button on any building you don't want to see,
 and it will disappear from the listing.
  You can also export your list of hidden buildings or import it later for easy management.
